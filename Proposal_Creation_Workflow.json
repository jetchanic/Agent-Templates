Use only the first object.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Step 1: Parse Relevant Information\n\nExtract from `proposalTemplate`:\n\n* solicitationNumber\n* agency\n* pointOfContact\n* submissionDeadline\n* submissionFormat\n\nThen pull key themes from `proposalInput.qaInputs`, `pmInputs`, and `requirementsInputs` for persuasive language.\n\n### Step 2: Your Task\n\ninstructions: `For each 'sections', 'sections[]', 'section[]', 'section', 'content', and 'content[]', produce a structured narrative without numeric values, retaining '[TO BE POPULATED]' placeholders. Include:\n### Required Sections:\n- Estimation methodology\n- Risk assumptions (list 3)\n- Compliance references (DFARS, FAR)\n- Cost realism and audit readiness\n\nYou **MUST** call the 'Think' tool to ensure that you have captured everything required in the proposalTemplate\n\nReturn all under one JSON object with the key \"costProposal\"",
